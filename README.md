Smart AdServer - MoPub SDK Adapter for Android
==============================================

Deprecated
----------
This repository and those adapters are now deprecated. They are not supported and will not be updated anymore.

Introduction
------------
The **_Smart AdServer Android SDK_** can be used with **_MoPub SDK_** through Custom Event Classes provided in this repository.
Supported Ad Formats are _Banners_, _Fullscreen_, _Rewarded Video_ and _Native Ads_.

Setup
-----

1) Install the **_Smart AdServer Android SDK_** in your Android Studio Project. You can follow the instructions in our [documentation](http://documentation.smartadserver.com/DisplaySDK/android/gettingstarted.html).


2) Checkout this repository and merge the src/ folder (containing adapter classes) into the src/ folder of your project. Folder structure should be as follows :
com/mopub/mobileads for all custom event (banner, interstitial, rewarded video, native) and utility classes.
com/mopub/nativeads for the specific MoPub renderer class for native ads with video content


4) _(Optional)_ **If you plan to use Native Ads with video, you need to register _`SmartAdServerNativeVideoAdRenderer`_ as a MoPubRenderer for mediated Smart AdServer native ads with video. More info on MoPub [documentation](http://www.mopub.com/resources/docs/android-sdk-integration/integrating-native-ads-android/).  **


5) On your MoPub's dashboard, create a new ***Custom Native Network*** under the _Networks_ tab, and fill your Ad Units with the relevant Custom Event Classes. _For example for a banner Ad Unit, set `com.mopub.mobileads.SmartAdServerBanner` as the **Custom Event Class**_.


6) Fill the _**Custom Event Class Data**_ with the informations of your _Smart AdServer's_ placements. You must use a valid JSON String and the 4 parameters : **siteid**, **pageid**, **formatid** and **target** must exist in this string. If you want to leave a parameter empty (_target for instance_) feel free to do it, as long as **all keys exist**.
  ```
  {"siteid":"your-siteID","pageid":"your-pageID","formatid":"your-formatID","target":"your-target-or-empty"}
  ```


7) Make sure your new _Custom Native Network_ is activated for your chosen Ad Units and Segments.


8) That's it, you're all set, you should be able to display _Smart AdServer's_ ads through your _MoPub SDK_ integration.
